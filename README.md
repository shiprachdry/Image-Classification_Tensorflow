# Image-Classification_Tensorflow
This projects uses DeepFashion dataset to train multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with different layers. These models are designed to classify user-uploaded images into one of the selected 5 categories. Additionally, I am integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to creatively generate product descriptions based on these images.
